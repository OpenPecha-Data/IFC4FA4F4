	<h2>Light on the Path of Liberation</h2>
<h3>The Life of the Second Buddha Vasubandhu</h3>
<p><strong><em>by Khenpo Shenpen Nangwa</em></strong></p>
<p>The <em>Root Tantra of MaÃ±juÅrÄ«</em> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dwelling thereafter<br/>
Will be a brahmin in the south,<br/>
Whose name begins with Ba [Va],<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a><br/>
The foremost exponent of the Buddhaâs teachings.<br/>
He will reside at the Arama StÅ«pa.<br/>
As a delightful reflection of the buddha<br/>
He will adorn everywhere,<br/>
As far as the limits of earth and ocean. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As this suggests, the great master Vasubandhu appeared in order to spread the teachings of Abhidharma. At a certain time, when the gong was struck at the great temple of NÄlandÄ in the noble land [of India], it was heard by a non-Buddhist expert in grammar, who realized that the Buddhist teachings had become predominant. He led an army that set fire to many temples, as a result of which the Abhidharma teachings were largely consumed by flames.</p>
<p>In addition, a king of Magadha formed an alliance with a king from the Persian borderlands, and they sent one another valuable treasures as gifts. On one occasion the Magadhan king discovered some precious seamless cloth and sent it as a present to his ally, but when the recipient looked at the gift, he regarded it as paltry and contemptible. In his anger he led an army that destroyed many of the temples of Magadha, thereby eliminating many Abhidharma teachings.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when two <em>tÄ«rthikas</em> arrived in NÄlandÄ to beg for alms, some deceitful monks treated them with disdain. The pair became angry. One of them entered a pit, saying, âI shall propitiate the sun.â The other provided him with provisions. When around nine years had passed and he still had not gained any accomplishment, he started to leave. The servant said, âI have presented my face to people and my ankles to dogs as I begged for what I have given you. If you havenât accomplished the powers of the sun, I shall have to kill you.â With that he took up his sword and approached his companion, who committed himself once more to the practice. After another three years of practice, he gained accomplishment. Then, as he gazed at the temple fire shot from his eyes, setting the temple ablaze, so that most of it burned down and the Abhidharma collection was on the point of disappearing. </p>
<p>At that time, a brahmin woman called PrasannaÅÄ«lÄ had two sons. Asaá¹ga, the elder brother, accomplished the practice of Maitreya at Kukkuá¹­apÄda Mountain. The younger brother, Vasubandhu, sought out many spiritual guides such as the Kashmiri Saá¹ghabhadra and mastered the scriptural collections of all the various schools. Still, he did not follow any MahÄyÄna teachers and therefore when he saw the treatises on the levels (<em>bhÅ«mi</em>) that Ärya Asaá¹ga had composed at NÄlandÄ he was disappointed, and he derided him by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alas! Asaá¹ga spent twelve years in the wilderness,<br/>
Practising meditation.<br/>
Without achieving any success in meditation,<br/>
He has instead composed these treatises<br/>
As a burden for an elephantâs back. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Ärya [Asaá¹ga] heard this he thought how wonderful if would be for his younger brother to enter the MahÄyÄna. He instructed two of his students to memorise the <em>Aká¹£ayamati SÅ«tra</em> and the <em>DaÅabhÅ«mika</em>. He told them to go and stay near Vasubandhuâs residence and to recite the first sÅ«tra aloud at dusk and the second at dawn. When they did so and Vasubandhu heard them, he first thought that the MahÄyÄna might have a positive cause but be devoid of fruition. Then, when he heard the chanting at dawn he realized that it is excellent in both cause and result. Knowing his elder brother to be the human worldâs authority on MahÄyÄna, he went to meet him. The two brothers then discussed the Dharma together. The younger brother proved more quick-witted but the elder provided excellent answers. Ärya [Asaá¹ga] said, âYour intelligence is keen because you have been born as a paá¹á¸ita in 500 lifetimes, whereas I can put questions to the supreme deity and report his answers.â Vasubandhu replied, âWell, let me see him too.â The venerable lord said, âYou are an ordinary being and have criticized the MahÄyÄna, so you will not see him in this life. As a means of purifying your obscurations, you should write multiple MahÄyÄna commentaries.â Vasubandhu was greatly inspired by this response. He said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>My elder brother is like a nÄga;<br/>
I am like a bird who longs for rain.<br/>
Although the nÄga king causes showers,<br/>
Still they have not passed into the birdâs throat. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he received all the MahÄyÄna sÅ«tras and treatises in their entirety from the master. Every day he read aloud texts such as the <em>Noble Eight Thousand Verses</em> for hours at a time. This master thus entered the MahÄyÄna and caused around five hundred monks who held the scriptural collections to enter the MahÄyÄna as well.</p>
<p>When Ärya Asaá¹ga had passed away, Vasubandhu became abbot of ÅrÄ« NÄlandÄ and carried out the ten dharmic activities every day without fail.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> He made it an inner rule to be diligent in the ten dharmic activities and said that there should be no interruption to each twenty-session teaching devoted to the Buddhaâs Words or the treatises. In all his debates with non-Buddhist outsiders he defeated his opponents through the use of flawless reasoning. He thus converted five thousand tÄ«rthikas to the Buddhist view. He established 108 dharma centres in Magadha and another 108 centres in Oá¸iviÅa. By sending emissaries to the south and elsewhere the master created several hundred dharma centres there too and was responsible for ordaining as many as sixty thousand monks who upheld the tenets of MahÄyÄna. Four of his students gained renown for excelling him in their learning: Guá¹aprabha as more learned in the Vinaya, Sthiramati as more learned in the Abhidharma, DignÄga as more learned in PramÄá¹a, and Ärya Vimuktisena as more learned in PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ. Thus, the holders of the masterâs dharma lineage grew to be incalculable. </p>
<p>In short, because there was no one at all after the Buddhaâs parinirvÄá¹a who matched this master either in learning or activity on behalf of the teachings, he became known throughout the noble land of India as Vasubandhu, the second buddha.</p>
<p>Nurturing the teachings like this, he also left treatises for posterity. In order to establish the texts of the YogÄcÄra MahÄyÄna, he wrote commentaries for the five treatises of Maitreya, as well as the <em>Twenty Verses</em>, <em>Thirty Verses</em>, and <em>Well-Explained Reasoning (VyÄkhyÄ-yukti)</em>. In particular, the fruit of all this great masterâs learningâupon the flowery vine of his birth and extensive education within this worldâwas the <em>Treasury of Abhidharma</em> together with its auto-commentary. This he bestowed for fortunate disciples so that they might extract its essence insatiably. </p>
<p>Finally, together with a thousand learned monk-followers who adhered to the training in ethical discipline he went to Nepal, where he established a great many dharma centres and expanded the saá¹gha. When he encountered some Nepalese monks called Hadu, who had given up the activity of study and meditation and were like mere reflections of genuine renunciants, simply adhering to the outer signs of monasticism, and witnessed them ploughing a field, he was dismayed by the degeneration of the teachings. By reciting backwards the <em>dhÄraá¹Ä«</em> of Uá¹£á¹Ä«á¹£avijayÄ he caused his vital energy to disperse. Still, for his devoted followers the text of the <em>Treasury of Abhidharma</em> is comparable in its effect to encountering the master in person.</p>
